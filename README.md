# s3k-grating-hack

s3k grating hack beta
for now theres:
- new options menu (in sound test)
- an option to get wheel glitch in cn2 starting from level select
- an option to change the angle of the wheel glitch at the start of cn2 (either facing right or down)
- remove time bonus option
- teleportation to a certain place for practice by pressing UP, C, B (more on that later)
- an option to reduce fbz1 miniboss hitcount
- an option to reduce lrz1 miniboss hitcount
- screen shift and lightning shield in doomsday 2 (final fight) starting from level select
- fire shield monitor at the start of sando 2 to practice fire shield route
- new level start positions (will be able to change them in options in the future) - 
1. mh2 starts in the ground to practice drop downs/zip (you can zip out to the right to practice glitchless but it breaks the pallete lol)
2. fbz1 starts right before the boss and theres a lightning shield for bottom route) (will look better in the future)
3. lava 2 starts before the tube after wrapping with monitor clip to practice stair clip
- 69 lives by default
- level select is turned on by default
- level select buttons are turned off (Except frame advance)
- level restart feature

THE OPTIONS ARE NOT BEING SAVED IN SRAM FOR THE TIME BEING!!!

this hack is in early state and is buggy so um yeah any requests and bug reports are welcome

about up c b teleportation:
for now it's only usable only in lr1 and de1. (even though you can still teleport on other levels but it will likely softlock you or smth... will fix later)
in lr1 it sends you to the place before the bossfight to practice monitor clip
in de1  it sends you to the spot after the zip. Mostly for graviton practice

to do:
- start positions options
- teleport destinations options
- fix doomsday 2
- saving options in sram
- make fb1 look better
- more quality of life and gameplay options
